## How to install

- Ensure you have Odin and the Samsung USB driver installed on your computer.
- Download the "up_param.tar" files.
- Put your phone in download mode by powering off the device, then pressing the volume up and down buttons simultaneously, and connecting it to the computer. A new screen should appear; press volume up to continue. Odin should detect the device after pressing the volume up button.
- Place "up_param.tar" in the AP slot in Odin, ensuring it is in the correct slot.
- Before clicking "Start," verify in Odin that the phone is detected, and confirm that "up_param.tar" is added.

Once completed, your phone should reboot normally.
